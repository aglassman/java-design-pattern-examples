Design Patterns - Java Examples
===

This project was created to give simple concrete examples of Object Oriented design patterns.  The patterns and their descriptions are taken from the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.  This book is commonly referred to as the GOF (Gang of Four) book, and is one of the most referenced books in OO design patterns.

The examples here are intended for teaching and learning purposes only.  You are free to use the examples and code, just be sure to credit Andrew Glassman for the code, and the GOF authors for the design patterns.
